# Hospital System 🏥

This Python project simulates a small hospital system.

It has 5 classes:
- Patient → to store patient info.
- Doctor → to store doctor info.
- Department → to group doctors.
- Appointment → to schedule appointments.
- Room → to assign patients to rooms.

Each class prints its info in a simple way.

You can test the classes by creating objects and printing them.
